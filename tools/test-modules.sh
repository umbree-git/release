# tools/test-modules.sh — the module gates.
#
# (1) LOCK      — every module's recorded sha256 matches its bytes, and every
#                 module on disk is listed. An edit without a version bump is
#                 what makes "which copy is newer" unanswerable across products.
# (2) DEPS      — every `# needs:` dependency is included EARLIER in each
#                 generated bootstrap that includes the dependent module. An
#                 undeclared order bug surfaces on an operator's machine as
#                 "command not found", after the download and before the gate.
#                 Also: any module (other than helpers itself) that CALLS
#                 fail/info/ok must declare `# needs: helpers` even if no
#                 bootstrap yet exposes the gap — the DEPS ordering check above
#                 only believes what a module declares about itself, so an
#                 under-declared dependency passes it clean today and dies on
#                 an operator's machine the day some other template composition
#                 splices this module without helpers ahead of it.
# (3) INCLUDED  — every module in MODULES.lock is @INCLUDEd by some generated
#                 bootstrap, or is recorded in MODULES.exclude as one this
#                 product deliberately does not carry. A locked-but-unused
#                 module syncs clean forever for code that does not ship.
# (4) GENERATOR — regenerating leaves every committed bootstrap byte-identical.
