# minisign is the trust root: it must already be on PATH from a trusted source
# (your package manager). We never auto-fetch the verifier — a binary pulled
# over the network and run unverified would itself become an unverified trust
# root, defeating the whole signature chain. Verification is mandatory and is
# only ever performed by a minisign the operator already trusts.
