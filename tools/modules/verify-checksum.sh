# module: verify-checksum  v4
# needs:  sha256 helpers
# since:  2026-08-25  (v3: portable — no --ignore-missing)
# v4: declares needs: helpers too — the block below calls fail(), which lives
# in the helpers module, not sha256. Under-declaring it was latent only because
# every current template happens to splice helpers before this module.
# Compare ONE hash directly instead of `-c --ignore-missing` over the whole
# sums file: --ignore-missing is a 2016-era addition (Digest::SHA 5.96 /
# coreutils 8.25) and the stock shasum on an older macOS rejects it outright
# ("Unknown option: ignore-missing"). That non-zero exit came back through the
# `||` as "checksum mismatch", so every install on such a host accused a
# perfectly good zip of tampering. Picking the line by EXACT filename (awk, both
# the "hash  name" and binary "hash *name" spellings) is also stricter than the
# substring grep this replaces.
