# tools/test-checksum-verify.sh — the outer bootstrap's checksum gate must work
# on hashers that predate `--ignore-missing`.
#
# The gate used to run `shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS.txt`. That
# option is a 2016-era addition (Digest::SHA 5.96 / coreutils 8.25): the stock
# shasum on an older macOS answers "Unknown option: ignore-missing" and exits
# non-zero, which the `||` reported as "checksum mismatch". Every install on
# such a host therefore accused an intact, correctly signed zip of tampering
# (seen 2026-08-25, a Burrowee gateway install on a 2012 Mac mini — the same
# defect Umbree's outer bootstrap carried its own copy of).
#
#     sh tools/test-checksum-verify.sh          # this shell
#     dash tools/test-checksum-verify.sh        # and this one, always
#
# (1) STATIC   — no bootstrap, template or generated, may name --ignore-missing,
#     and the advice a human READS — site/index.html, the release notes in
#     tools/release.sh — must verify one file by exact name rather than run
#     `-c` over the whole sums file, which fails on an intact download.
# (2) BEHAVIOR — the shipped block, extracted verbatim from umbree/install.sh
#     (Umbree's single component), is driven against a stub `shasum` that
#     models the old one: good zip verifies, tampered zip aborts, absent entry
#     aborts, and a name that merely CONTAINS the wanted one is not mistaken
#     for it.
