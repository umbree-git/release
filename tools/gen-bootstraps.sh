#!/bin/sh
# gen-bootstraps.sh — generate the self-contained outer bootstrap (umbree/install.sh)
# from one template.
#
# The generated file is a direct render of the template with the @COMP@ and
# @PUBKEY@ substitutions applied. The outer bootstrap is THE TRUST ANCHOR, so
# the baked @PUBKEY@ must be the real release signing pubkey before activation.
#
# Pubkey resolution (first that exists wins):
#   1. $UMBREE_PUBKEY_FILE   (explicit override; used by the offline E2E test)
#   2. umbree-release.pub    (the REAL release signing pubkey — once minted/activated)
#   3. tools/testkeys/test.pub (the local TEST key)
#   4. none -> a clearly-marked TEMP placeholder is baked in, and the generated
#      bootstrap WILL refuse to run (the runtime guards on *TEMP*). Regenerate
#      once a real key exists.
#
# The @PUBKEY@ value is the base64 key line of a minisign .pub file (the last
# non-comment line) — exactly what `minisign -V -P <pubkey>` expects inline.
