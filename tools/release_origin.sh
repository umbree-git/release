# release_origin.sh — where a release cut is allowed to build from, as predicates
# sourced by tools/release.sh and tools/release.command.
#
# Copied from burrowee-git/release tools/release_origin.sh (main @ 4931d19,
# 2026-09-05) with the brand strings swapped and two umbree additions:
# beta_branch_for (the beta branch is resolved here, not in release.sh) and a
# channel-aware staged_tolerance_for. Function names are kept so the two files
# stay diffable.
#
# A cut stamps a version onto whatever commit it finds in the tree it was
# pointed at, so the choice of tree is a correctness property: if the tree is
# not origin/main, the published version names a commit the world cannot fetch.
# These checks are the last thing between a stale checkout and a published
# artifact, which is why they live here as functions rather than inline in the
# orchestrator — tools/release_origin.test.sh exercises them directly, with no part
# of the release path running.
#
# Design: burrowee's docs/specs/2026-08-03-cut-origin-and-worktree-flow-design.md
# (burrowee-git/resources); umbree's adoption is feature 04 of the
# 2026-09-05 brand-root-and-beta-channel project (umbree-git/resources).

# is_registry_source <dir> <expected> — dir is the registry main folder for its
# component. `expected` is release.sh's OWN default for that component, so
# this is the table a CUT is checked against, not a second definition
# maintained here. That table is also derived in tools/release.command
# (UMBREE_SRC_* defaults) — this predicate does not claim a second copy does
# not exist, only that a cut's pass/fail can never disagree with release.sh's
# own idea of the registry path.

# --git-common-dir coincide only in the primary worktree (a linked one reports
# <main>/.git/worktrees/<name> for the former). --path-format=absolute is what
# makes the comparison sound — --git-common-dir otherwise prints a path

# — the whole guard for one tree, cheapest check first so a local mistake fails
# in milliseconds and only a fully-local-clean tree costs a network round trip.
#
# mode=strict  → first failure prints "✗ …" to stderr and returns 1 (a real cut)
# mode=report  → findings print "⚠ …" to stderr and 0 is returned (--dry-run,
#                which publishes nothing, so an override is a legitimate
#                rehearsal rather than an error)
#
# label is the component name (or "release repo") and appears in every message:
# a cut reads six trees, so "which one" is the first thing an operator needs.
#
# [channel] is stable (default) or beta, consumed from the next positional
# ONLY when it is shaped like a channel token: exactly "stable"/"beta" is
# accepted; anything containing "/" is assumed to be the first
# [allowed-staged...] entry (every real tolerance path looks like
# versions/<comp>[.stamp] — staged_tolerance_for never emits a bare word) and
# left alone; anything else — empty, wrong case ("Beta"), misspelled
# ("betaa") — is a caller bug, not a tree finding, so it is refused outright
# with "✗ <label> unknown channel: <token>" and returns 1 UNCONDITIONALLY,
# even under mode=report. This is what lets every pre-existing call site
# (release.sh's stable verb, which passes no channel) keep working unmodified while still closing the door on a
# computed channel variable (a future caller) landing here empty or
# misspelled and silently cutting from the wrong tree. beta redirects the
# whole guard at a second, structurally different origin:
# <registry-main>/../beta (beta_worktree_for), which must be a
# LINKED worktree of the registry main repo (is_linked_worktree_of) — never
# configured separately, so it cannot drift from the registry entry — on
# the beta branch beta_branch_for resolves, clean, == origin/<that branch>. A missing beta worktree is refused with
# its path and the fix (spec §5.2); nothing here ever creates one.
#
# [allowed-staged...] is the output of staged_tolerance_for — the paths THIS
# ONE tree may carry staged instead of clean. It applies only to the clean-tree
# check below, and only to the single <dir> being asserted here; every other
